# Language-Detector
Key Features:

Text Preprocessing: The framework includes text preprocessing steps such as tokenization, stopword removal, and stemming to prepare the textual data for language detection. This ensures the quality and consistency of input data for accurate language identification.

Feature Extraction: Utilizing techniques like CountVectorizer, the framework extracts features from text data, transforming it into numerical representations suitable for machine learning algorithms.

Machine Learning Models: The framework implements various machine learning models to classify text data into different languages. These models are trained on labeled datasets to learn the language patterns and make predictions on unseen text.

Technologies Used:

Python
pandas
NumPy
NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)
scikit-learn
Description:

This project uses NLP techniques (stopwords, stemming, CountVectorizer) for language detection, with Random Forest classification by utilising hyperparameter tuning. Train on your own data and explore different languages!
